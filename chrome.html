<h1>A history of Chrome</h1>

  <p>Google's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Schmidt">Eric Schmidt</a> opposed the development of
    an independent web browser for six years. He stated that "at the time, Google was a small company," and
    he did not want to go through "bruising browser wars." After co-founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page hired
    several Mozilla Firefox developers and built a demonstration of Chrome, however, Schmidt admitted that "It
    was so good that it essentially forced me to change my mind."</p>

  <p>In December 2010 Google announced that to make it easier for businesses to use Chrome they would provide
    an official Chrome MSI package. For business use it is helpful to have full-fledged MSI packages that can
    be customized via transform files (.mst) - but the MSI provided with Chrome is only a very limited MSI
    wrapper fitted around the normal installer, and many businesses find that this arrangement does not meet
    their needs.</p>
